<h2><a name="writing-templates"></a>How do I create my own templates?</h2>
<p>
  In the <em>Template</em> tab on the options page you can click on the <em>&quot;Need help writing templates?&quot;</em>
  link at the bottom to view the built-in help section for writing templates. If
  for some crazy reason you don't yet have <a href="/template">Template</a> installed
  (can't understand why not) you can still learn about <a href="/template/writing-templates">writing templates here</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="special-pages"></a>Why can't I use some features on certain pages?</h2>
<p>
  Due to <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome's</a> security implementations
  some features won't work on certain pages. These pages are anything on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  and any <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> using the
  <code>chrome://</code> protocol as these are pages internal to the browser (including
  pages specific to extensions/apps). In these cases keyboard shortcuts, context
  (right-click) menus as well as extraction of selected <a href="/template/writing-templates/simple-values#selection">text</a>/<a href="/template/writing-templates/complex-values#selectionLinks">links</a>
  <em>may</em> not work.
</p>
<h2><a name="saving"></a>Why are the changes to my templates not being saved?</h2>
<p>
  On the options page be sure that you <strong>always</strong> press <em>&quot;Save &amp; Close&quot;</em>
  button whenever you want to save your changes. This applies even when you are
  only adding, deleting, reordering and importing templates.
</p>
<h2><a name="predefined-templates"></a>Why can I not edit some templates?</h2>
<p>
  The title and content fields of predefined templates (<abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>,
  Short, Anchor etc.) are read-only and cannot be changed. Also, you cannot delete
  these templates but you can disable them like any other template to prevent them
  from being used.
</p>
<h2><a name="supported-extensions"></a>What exactly do you mean &quot;Supported Extensions&quot;?</h2>
<p>
  The extensions that are listed in the <a href="/template#supported-extensions">Supported Extensions</a>
  section have treated specially by <a href="/template">Template</a> so that the
  tab <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> and title can
  still be extracted. These extensions tend only to be those that would mask the
  <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> and other information
  of the current page.
</p>
<h2><a name="context-menu"></a>What <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> is used when I right-click on a page?</h2>
<p>
  Well, that absolutely depends what it is you right-clicked on. <a href="/template">Template</a>
  currently checks what you clicked on in the following priority;
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Frame</strong> - Right-clicking anywhere within an internal frame
  </li>
  <li><strong>Link</strong> - Right-clicking on a link</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Media</strong> - Right-clicking on anything that has a <code>src</code>
    attribute (e.g. images)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Page</strong> - Right-clicking anywhere else on the page that doesn't
    match any of the above
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  There is currently an issue raised that involves re-prioritizing this list so
  if you're interested <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template/issues/36">take a look</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="permissions"></a>Why do you need this permission...?</h2>
<p>
  I've seen people commenting a lot on extensions in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  about the permissions required by that extension. Most of these comments are negative
  and usually posted by people who do not fully understand the creation of Chrome
  extensions. For this reason I have <a href="/template/permissions">created a breakdown</a>
  of the permissions used by <a href="/template">Template</a>. However, if you have
  trust issues and don't trust that summary why not <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template">look at the code</a>
  and see for yourself.
</p>
<h2><a name="languages"></a>How can I get Template in a different language?</h2>
<p>
  Currently, this extension is only provided in the English but I am hoping to support
  more languages in the future. I am currently working on a method of allowing others
  to easily submit translations and I will update this space when it is available.
</p>
<h2><a name="errors"></a>Why am I seeing this error message...?</h2>
<p>
  Due to the extent of customization options available for <a href="/template">Template</a>
  it's no surprise that something could go wrong. If it does it's nice to know what
  that error message means;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Empty templates cannot be copied&quot;</strong> - This occurs
    if the template being used has either no content or the result after being parsed
    is empty. If you think about it, you can't exactly copy an empty string to the
    clipboard can you? Go on and try, I'll wait... I told you so.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;URL is not properly encoded&quot;</strong> - This occurs if the
    user is attempting to use <a href="/template">Template</a> on a <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    that is not properly encoded. This is due to the underlying technology used
    for extract the information on each <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    (e.g. domain, port, parameters).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;An error occurred when collecting page information&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs when an unexpected error was thrown when building up the template
    data. Please can you <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template/issues">raise an issue</a>
    while providing as much information as possible so I can investigate and fix
    it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Template could not be copied&quot;</strong> - This occurs when
    an unexpected error was thrown during the copy process. Please can you <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template/issues">raise an issue</a>
    while providing as much information as possible so I can investigate and fix
    it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Configuration problem found with &lt;URL Shortener&gt;&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs if the active <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    shortener requires a target <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    to be specified and this has not been done (e.g. <a href="http://yourls.org">YOURLS</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Could not get a successful response from &lt;URL Shortener&gt;&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs if the <a href="/template">Template</a> is unable to successfully
    get a response from the active <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    shortener. This can be for multiple reasons but you should check you configuration
    for that service first.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="url-copy"></a>What happened to &quot;URL Copy&quot;?</h2>
<p>
  This extension was previously named &quot;URL Copy&quot; but was renamed in <a href="/template/changes#0.2.0.0">v0.2.0.0</a>
  as I felt it had evolved far beyond that and the name no longer did it justice.
  &quot;<a href="/template">Template</a>&quot; provides a much more accurate description
  of the functionality and power of this extension.
</p>
<h2><a name="updating"></a>Why isn't Chrome updating Template?</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome's</a> update frequency is slightly unpredictable
  (at least in my eyes) and I've found that sometimes it updates my extensions as
  soon as they're updated but I've also seen it some extensions not getting updated
  even when using the browser for hours. However, there is a little-known way (at
  least to non-developers) to force it to update your extensions;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the Extensions page via on of the following methods;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Main Menu: Tools &gt; Extensions</li>
    <li>Address Bar: <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a></li>
    <li>
      Right-click <a href="/template">Template's</a> toolbar icon and select <em>&quot;Manage extensions...&quot;</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Click on <em>&quot;Developer mode&quot;</em> in the top right of the page so
    that it has a collapse (-) icon on its left.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <em>&quot;Update extensions now&quot;</em> button, et viola!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your extensions should now be receiving updates (where available) and you may
  notice some extensions turning off and on again. If an extension requires any
  additional permissions that you have not already authorized it will not be turned
  back on until you have granted these permissions.
</p>
