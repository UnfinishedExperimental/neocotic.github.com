<h2><a name="saving"></a>Why are the changes to my orders not being saved?</h2>
<p>
  On the options page be sure that you <strong>always</strong> press <em>&quot;Save &amp; Close&quot;</em>
  button whenever you want to save your changes. This applies even when you are
  only adding or deleting orders.
</p>
<h2><a name="errors"></a>Why is there an error icon in the popup?</h2>
<p>
  If there was a problem parsing an order's page you may see this error icon as
  well as any of the responsible orders highlighted. If you hover over the highlighted
  order label will see a short explanation of what caused the error. In most cases
  this will be due to incorrect order data being provided so check these on the
  options page (click the help buttons next to each field for more information).
</p>
<p>
  However, due to the method in which <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a> retrieves order
  status updates it may be that the <abbr rel="twipsy" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
  structure of the order pages have changed and preventing the necessary values
  from being extracted. If you believe that this is the case please take the steps
  to <a href="/iOrder#issues">raise this as an issue</a> so that I can issue an
  update for this extension. This is not something I will easily notice as I'm not
  <strong>always</strong> buying iDevices from the <a href="http://store.apple.com/">Apple store</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="permissions"></a>Why do you need this permission...?</h2>
<p>
  I've seen people commenting a lot on extensions in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  about the permissions required by that extension. Most of these comments are negative
  and usually posted by people who do not fully understand the creation of Chrome
  extensions. For this reason I have <a href="/iOrder/permissions">created a breakdown</a>
  of the permissions used by <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a>. However, if you have
  trust issues and don't trust that summary why not <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/iOrder">look at the code</a>
  and see for yourself.
</p>
<h2><a name="languages"></a>How can I get iOrder in a different language?</h2>
<p>
  Currently, this extension is only provided in the English but I am hoping to support
  more languages in the future. I am currently working on a method of allowing others
  to easily submit translations and I will update this space when it is available.
