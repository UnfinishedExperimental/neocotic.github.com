<h3><a name="errors"></a>Why is there an error icon in the popup?</h3>
<p>
  If there was a problem parsing an order's page you may see this error icon as
  well as any of the responsible orders highlighted. If you hover over the highlighted
  order label will see a short explanation of what caused the error. In most cases
  this will be due to incorrect order data being provided so check these on the
  options page (click the help buttons next to each field for more information).
</p>
<p>
  However, due to the method in which <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a> retrieves order
  status updates it may be that the <abbr rel="tooltip" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
  structure of the order pages have changed and preventing the necessary values
  from being extracted. If you believe that this is the case please take the steps
  to <a href="/iOrder#issues">raise this as an issue</a> so that I can issue an
  update for this extension. This is not something I will easily notice as I'm
  not <strong>always</strong> buying iDevices from the <a href="http://store.apple.com/">Apple store</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="permissions"></a>Why do you need this permission...?</h3>
<p>
  I've seen people commenting a lot on extensions in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  about the permissions required by that extension. Most of these comments are
  negative and usually posted by people who do not fully understand the creation
  of Chrome extensions. For this reason I have <a href="/iOrder/permissions">created a breakdown</a>
  of the permissions used by <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a>. However, if you have
  trust issues and don't trust that summary why not <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/iOrder">look at the code</a>
  and see for yourself.
</p>
<h3><a name="languages"></a>How can I get iOrder in a different language?</h3>
<p>
  We are using an online system powered by <a href="http://crowdin.net">crowdin</a>
  to manage translations. Please visit <a href="http://crowdin.net/project/iorder">crowdin.net/project/iorder</a>
  if you want to help.
</p>
<h3><a name="updating"></a>Why isn't Chrome updating iOrder?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome's</a> update frequency is slightly
  unpredictable (at least in my eyes) and I've found that sometimes it updates
  my extensions as soon as an update becomes available but I've also seen it some
  extensions not getting updated even when using the browser for hours. However,
  there is a little-known way (at least to non-developers) to force it to update
  your extensions;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the Extensions page via on of the following methods;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Main Menu: Tools &gt; Extensions</li>
    <li>
      Address Bar: <a href="chrome://chrome/extensions">chrome://chrome/extensions</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Right-click <a href="/iOrder">iOrder's</a> toolbar icon and select <em>&quot;Manage extensions...&quot;</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Ensure that <em>&quot;Developer mode&quot;</em> in the top right of the page
    is checked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <em>&quot;Update extensions now&quot;</em> button, et viola!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your extensions should now be receiving updates (where available) and you may
  notice some extensions turning off and on again. If an extension requires any
  additional permissions that you have not already authorized it will not be turned
  back on until you have granted these permissions.
</p>
<h3><a name="saving"></a>Why are the changes to my orders not being saved?</h3>
<p>
  This section is only relevant for versions before <a href="/iOrder/changes#2.0.0">2.0.0</a>
  where changes are now saved automatically on the options page.
</p>
<p>
  On the options page be sure that you <strong>always</strong> press <em>&quot;Save &amp; Close&quot;</em>
  button whenever you want to save your changes. This applies even when you are
  only adding or deleting orders.
