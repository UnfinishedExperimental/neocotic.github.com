<p>
  The <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> permissions mentioned
  on this page are required by the <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a> extension to function.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these permissions can be quite scary so I have attempted to explain why
  each one is required. If you doubt these explanations or are simply curious please
  feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/iOrder">source code</a>
  yourself. It is open source after all.

  These permissions are displayed on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kflemogpkbophbipihnbcmlplbihbdhb">extension's page</a>
  and on the warning message displayed to the user;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your data on neocotic.com&quot;</strong> - This is required to
    for the <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/inline_installation.html">inline installations</a>
    process to update the <em>Install</em> buttons on the homepage once <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a>
    has been successfully installed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your data on store.apple.com&quot;</strong> - This is required
    as <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a> requests your order's page from this website
    and parses the response to check for any status updates and to extract the
    tracking link.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your tabs and browsing activity&quot;</strong> - This is required
    to prevent the <em>Options</em> link in the popup from opening a new tab each
    time it's clicked.
  </li>
</ul>
