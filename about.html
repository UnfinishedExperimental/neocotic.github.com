        Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Alasdair Mercer</span> from
        <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Dunfermline,+Fife,+United+Kingdom" itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"><span itemprop="locality">Dunfermline</span>, <span itemprop="country-name">Scotland</span></a>.
        However, you may know me as <em>&quot;<span itemprop="nickname">neocotic</span>&quot;</em>
        if you've seen me online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently working as a <span itemprop="title">Java Web Developer</span>
        for <a href="http://rbs.com" itemprop="affiliation">The Royal Bank of Scotland</a>
        and have been since 2008. Although it allows me to work on extremely large
        projects with some exceptional people I get much more excited working on
        my <a href="https://github.com/neocotic">personal development projects</a>
        when I get any spare time as I'm able to be much more creative and experimental.
        The main purpose for <a href="http://neocotic.com" itemprop="url">this website</a>
        is to post about my interests as well as what I've discovered during development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a huge game enthusiast and can be found primarily on <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/MyXbox/Profile?gamertag=neocotic">Xbox Live</a>,
        <a href="http://us.playstation.com/playstation/psn/visit/profiles/Apehawk" rel="tooltip" title="PlayStation Network">PSN</a>
        and <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/neocotic/">Steam</a> but I play
        a lot of PC games as well. Although I tend to play all genres I am a total
        sucker for a good <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr>
        or <abbr rel="tooltip" title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Movies (good and bad) are also a big part of my life and have always been
        something that I'm very passionate about. Even though it was released back
        in 1999, my first love has to have been <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>
        as I must have watched it each day for months after first buying it (don't
        even talk to me about the sequels though).
      </p>
      <h3><a name="neocotic"></a>neo&middot;cot&middot;ic</h3>
      <p>
        This name was first used as my alias on <a href="http://xbox.com/live">Xbox Live</a>
        back in 2002 and it's a simple combination of <em>neo</em> and <em>narcotic</em>
        which resembled my addiction to <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>
        and it just sort of stuck. There was a small period where I used the moniker
        <em>&quot;Apehawk&quot;</em> but that remans only on <a href="http://us.playstation.com/psn/" rel="tooltip" title="PlayStation Network">PSN</a>,
        and only because they don't allow name changes (or at least not yet).
