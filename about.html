  <p>
    Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Alasdair Mercer</span> from
    <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=Dunfermline,+Fife,+United+Kingdom" itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://data-vocabulary.org/Address"><span itemprop="locality">Dunfermline</span>, <span itemprop="country-name">Scotland</span></a>.
    However, you may know me as <em>&quot;<span itemprop="nickname">neocotic</span>&quot;</em> if you've seen me online.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently working as a <span itemprop="title">Java Web Developer</span> for <a href="http://rbs.com" itemprop="affiliation">The Royal Bank of Scotland</a>
    and have been since 2008. Although it allows me to work on extremely large projects with some exceptional people I get much more
    excited working on my <a href="https://github.com/neocotic">personal development projects</a> when I get any spare time as I'm
    able to be much more creative and experimental. The main purpose for <a href="/" itemprop="url">this website</a> is to post about
    my interests as well as what I've discovered during development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also a huge game enthusiast and can be found primarily on <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/MyXbox/Profile?gamertag=neocotic">Xbox Live</a>,
    <a href="http://us.playstation.com/playstation/psn/visit/profiles/Apehawk" title="PlayStation Network">PSN</a> and
    <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/neocotic/">Steam</a> but I play a lot of PC games as well. Although I tend to play all
    genres I am a total sucker for a good <abbr title="Role Playing Game">RPG</abbr> or <abbr title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Movies (good and bad) are also a big part of my life and I've always been very passionate about them. Even though it was
    released back in 1999, my first love has to have been <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a> as I must
    have watched it each day for months after first buying it (don't even talk to me about the sequels though).
  </p>
  <h3><a name="neocotic"></a>neo&middot;cot&middot;ic</h3>
  <p>
    This name was first used as my alias on <a href="http://xbox.com/live">Xbox Live</a> back in 2002 and it's a simple
    combination of <em>neo</em> and <em>narcotic</em> which resembled my addiction to <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>
    and it just sort of stuck. There was a small period where I used the moniker <em>&quot;Apehawk&quot;</em> but that remans only
    on <a href="http://us.playstation.com/psn/" title="PlayStation Network">PSN</a> and only because they don't allow name changes
    (or at least not yet).
