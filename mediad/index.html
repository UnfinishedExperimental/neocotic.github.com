<p>
  <a href="/mediad">mediad</a> is an online directory which allows users to list
  their media collection as well as the ability to share it with their friends.
</p>
<p>
  The project was originally developed in Java and targeted for the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
  However, this plan was dropped as I wanted to increase the scope of this project
  by rewriting it in <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>
  as well as changing the whole approach.
</p>
<p>
  This project is back in the planning stage and development has not yet restarted.
  This is a massive undertaking for me and I want to make sure I get it right as
  I've had this idea for almost a decade and I'm very passionate about it.
