<p>
  Today I made a quick 1.0.2 release for <a href="/qrcode.js">qrcode.js</a> which
  contains renamed methods within the <abrr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
  which I feel will make it more simple and understandable to use.
</p>
<p>
  I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend using <code>QRCode.image</code> and <code>QRCode.canvas</code>
  from now on as their old method names will probably be completely removed in a
  future release (not sure when though).
</p>
<h3><a name="qrcode.js-changes-1.0.2"></a>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Deprecated <code>generateCanvas</code> and <code>generateImage</code> and
    replaced with <code>canvas</code> and <code>image</code> respectively
  </li>
</ul>
