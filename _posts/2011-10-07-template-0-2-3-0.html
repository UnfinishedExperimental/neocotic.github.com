<p>
  I've decided to release a small update for <a href="/template">Template</a> today.
  Version 0.2.3.0 includes some minor changes but mainly a redesign of the icons
  used.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> recently contacted all extension developers
  saying that icons, screenshots and promotional images must meet their new criteria
  to be promoted on their <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  so I thought I better update my images since I'm struggling to keep it above 200
  users at the moment. Honestly, I didn't like the previous logo but I'm not exactly
  100% sure about the new one except when I used it in the promotional images.
</p>
<p>
  I think I'll find another logo to use in the extension itself as it doesn't look
  great in the toolbar... Expect a 0.2.3.1 update within the week ;)
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, 0.3.0.0 is still a bit away as I am currently working on some new
  projects I've had ideas for and it will take a lot of effort to do right. I am
  hoping to have it completed before 2012 though as I want to have the final release
  (1.0.0) done before the extension is a year old.
