  Since I created my first <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>
  extension, <a href="/template">Template</a> (then <em>URL Copy</em>), I have
  struggled to keep my user base over 200 users. Some weeks it would be just over
  the mark and then drop anywhere from 50 to 100 users, and the cycle would start
  all over again.
</p>
<p>
  However, since the <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-chrome-even-more-app-ealing.html">recent update</a>
  for the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/home">Chrome Web Store</a>
  I've seen a steady increase in users and I'm really glad to say that <a href="/template">Template</a>
  has crossed the 1,000 user mark (1,011 when publishing this post). Hurray! After
  <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/template-chrome/estimated_cost">all of the effort</a>
  I've put in to it it's amazing to finally see it reaching people.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure what exactly increased its visibility and/or attractiveness but
  Google have definitely done something right. Maybe it was the fact that I adopted
  the new promotional and supporting image specifications early. Maybe it was the
  fancy unicode characters I added to the description. Or maybe it just got noticed.
  The truth is I'll never know, but I just hope it continues.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I can't really say the same for my second extension, <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a>,
  as it seems to be stuck around 15 users. However, I'm not too frustrated by this
  as it was a little experiment and tool mainly for my own use that I thought I'd
  share. It's just a shame I didn't finish it before the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>
  release date.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the web store's new look is great for users and developers alike. Plus,
  it gave me the opportunity to <a href="https://github.com/phaistonian/MyExtensions/pulls/neocotic">contribute</a>
  to one of my most used extensions, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/igejgfmbjjjjplnnlgnbejpkpdajkblm">My Extensions</a>.
  Any Chrome extension developers out there should definitely use this extension
  by <a href="http://georgepapadakis.me/">George Papadakis'</a> to keep track of
  their user base.
