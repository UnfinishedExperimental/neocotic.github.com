<p>
  I've finally got around to releasing version 1.0.0 of the <a href="/jsonx">JSONX</a>
  JavaScript library as well as its associated <a href="/jquery-jsonx">jQuery plugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The library and plugin both allow simple transformation between <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>
  and <abbr rel="twipsy" title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
  This is the first release so there is definitely room for improvement and I'm
  sure through testing and common usage some bugs will be revealed but please give
  them a try now so they can mature in to something great.
