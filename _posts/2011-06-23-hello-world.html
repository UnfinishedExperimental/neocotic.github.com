<p>
  This is my first post on what is hopefully my final attempt at a central website
  for me. Here I will post my thoughts on pretty much anything, from movie reviews
  to programming hints &amp; tips. I will also be hosting information on my many
  ongoing <a href="https://github.com/neocotic">projects</a> here so be sure to
  check-in for the latest updates.
</p>
<p>
  However, as you can probably tell, this site is nowhere near complete but I'll
  be doing that as I go. Missing content will be filled, cosmetic touch ups (and
  some overhauls) as well as restructuring changes. Once all that's done I should
  have a nice wee place on the internet to share my ramblings outside of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/alasdair.mercer">facebook</a>,
  <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/neocotic">twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/114861910136746455630/posts">Google+</a>.
</p>
<p>I hope you like it and enjoy the content I promise to bring.</p>
