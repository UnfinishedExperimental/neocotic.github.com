  After finding myself constantly refreshing the order page for my new <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 4S</a>
  I decided I would ease the pain of others waiting for their iDevice orders to
  be updated. <a href="/iOrder">iOrder</a> is a unique and simple <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>
  extension that needs only the order number and delivery zip/post code to keep
  you automatically updated with the progress of your order.

<p>Don't just take my word for it, try it yourself!</p>
