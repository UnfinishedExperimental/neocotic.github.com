<h3><a name="writing-templates"></a>How do I create my own templates?</h3>
<p>
  Either click the <strong>?</strong> icon in the navigation or the link under
  the content text box within the <em>Templates</em> tab on the options page to
  view the built-in guide for writing templates. If for some crazy reason you don't
  yet have <a href="/template">Template</a> installed (can't understand why not)
  you can still learn about <a href="/template/guide">writing templates here</a>.
</p>
<h3><a name="special-pages"></a>Why can't I use some features on certain pages?</h3>
<p>
  Due to <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome's</a> security implementations
  some features won't work on certain pages. These pages include anything on the
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a> and any <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
  using the <code>chrome://</code> protocol as these are pages internal to the
  browser (including pages specific to extensions/apps). In these cases keyboard
  shortcuts and variables extracted by parsing the <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>
  <em>may</em> not work.
</p>
<h3><a name="predefined-templates"></a>Why can I not edit some templates?</h3>
<p>
  The title and content fields of predefined templates (<abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>,
  Short, Anchor etc.) are read-only and cannot be changed. Also, you cannot delete
  these templates but you can still disable them like any other template to prevent
  them from being used.
</p>
<h3><a name="supported-extensions"></a>What exactly does &quot;Supported Extensions&quot; mean?</h3>
<p>
  The extensions that are listed in the <a href="/template#supported-extensions">Supported Extensions</a>
  section are treated specially by <a href="/template">Template</a> so that the
  tab <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> and title
  can still be extracted. These extensions tend only to be those that would mask
  the <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> and other
  information of the current page.
</p>
<h3><a name="context-menu"></a>What URL is used when I right-click on a page?</h3>
<p>
  Well, that absolutely depends what it is you right-clicked on. <a href="/template">Template</a>
  currently checks what you clicked on in the following priority;
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Link</strong> - Right-clicking on a link</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Media</strong> - Right-clicking on anything that has a <code>src</code>
    attribute (e.g. images)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Frame</strong> - Right-clicking anywhere within an internal frame
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Page</strong> - Right-clicking anywhere else on the page that doesn't
    match any of the above
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="permissions"></a>Why do you need this permission...?</h3>
<p>
  I've seen people commenting a lot on extensions in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  about the permissions required by that extension. Most of these comments are
  negative and usually posted by people who do not fully understand the creation
  of Chrome extensions. For this reason I have <a href="/template/permissions">created a breakdown</a>
  of the permissions used by <a href="/template">Template</a>. However, if you
  have trust issues and don't trust that summary why not <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template">look at the code</a>
  and see for yourself.
</p>
<h3><a name="languages"></a>How can I get Template in a different language?</h3>
<p>
  We are using an online system powered by <a href="http://crowdin.net">crowdin</a>
  to manage translations. Please visit <a href="http://i18n.tmpl.at">i18n.tmpl.at</a>
  if you want to help.
</p>
<h3><a name="errors"></a>Why am I seeing this error message...?</h3>
<p>
  Due to the extent of customization options available for <a href="/template">Template</a>
  it's no surprise that something could go wrong. If it does it's nice to know
  what that error message means;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;<em>&lt;template&gt;</em> output was empty&quot;</strong> - This
    occurs if the template being used either has no content or the result after
    being rendered is empty. If you think about it, you can't exactly copy an empty
    string to the clipboard can you? Go on and try, I'll wait... I told you so.
    What would you expect to paste after all.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;The URL is not properly encoded&quot;</strong> - This occurs
    if you are attempting to use <a href="/template">Template</a> on a <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    that is not properly encoded. This is due to the underlying technology used
    for extract the information on each <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    (e.g. domain, port, parameters). This should be extremely rare and could probably
    be impossible to occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;An error occurred while collecting information&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs when an unexpected error occurred when building up the template
    data. Please can you <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template/issues">raise an issue</a>
    while providing as much information as possible so I can investigate and fix
    it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;<em>&lt;template&gt;</em> could not be copied&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs when an unexpected error occurred somewhere during the process.
    Please can you <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template/issues">raise an issue</a>
    while providing as much information as possible so I can investigate and fix
    it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;<em>&lt;shortener&gt;</em> has not been configured correctly&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs if the active <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    shortener requires a target <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    to be specified and this has not been done (e.g. <a href="http://yourls.org">YOURLS</a>).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;<em>&lt;shortener&gt;</em> experienced a problem while shortening <em>&lt;url&gt;</em>&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs if the <a href="/template">Template</a> is unable to get a successful
    response from the active <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    shortener. This can be for multiple reasons but you should check your configuration
    for that service first.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;<em>&lt;shortener&gt;</em> experienced a problem&quot;</strong>
    - This occurs when an unexpected error occurred during the request to the active
    <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> shortener.
    Please can you <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template/issues">raise an issue</a>
    while providing as much information as possible so I can investigate and fix
    it.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="updating"></a>Why isn't Chrome updating Template?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome's</a> update frequency is slightly
  unpredictable (at least in my eyes) and I've found that sometimes it updates
  my extensions as soon as an update becomes available but I've also seen it some
  extensions not getting updated even when using the browser for hours. However,
  there is a little-known way (at least to non-developers) to force it to update
  your extensions;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the Extensions page via on of the following methods;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Main Menu: Tools &gt; Extensions</li>
    <li>Address Bar: <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a></li>
    <li>
      Right-click <a href="/template">Template's</a> toolbar icon and select <em>&quot;Manage extensions...&quot;</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Ensure that <em>&quot;Developer mode&quot;</em> in the top right of the page
    is checked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <em>&quot;Update extensions now&quot;</em> button, et viola!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your extensions should now be receiving updates (where available) and you may
  notice some extensions turning off and on again. If an extension requires any
  additional permissions that you have not already authorized it will not be turned
  back on until you have granted these permissions.
</p>
<h3><a name="url-copy"></a>What happened to <em>URL Copy</em>?</h3>
<p>
  This extension was previously named <em>URL Copy</em> but was renamed in version
  <a href="/template/changes#0.2.0.0">0.2.0.0</a> as it had evolved far beyond
  just doing that so the name no longer did it justice. <em>Template</em> provides
  a much more accurate description of the functionality and power of this extension.
</p>
<h3>
  <a name="oauth"></a>Why am I no longer logged in to my URL shortener accounts?
</h3>
<p>
  This section is only relevant for versions updating to <a href="/template/changes#1.0.1">1.0.1</a>
  from a previous version as the <a href="http://oauth.net">OAuth</a> implementation
  was upgraded to <a href="http://oauth.net/2">2.0</a> in this release.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the authorization provided by these services were not compatible
  with the latest version of this framework so you'll need to re-authorize each
  affected service in order to associate the links to your account. The <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
  key and username for the <a href="http://bit.ly">bit.ly</a> service has been
  replaced with the new login/logout functionality for easier use and improved
  security.
</p>
<h3><a name="saving"></a>Why are the changes to my templates not being saved?</h3>
<p>
  This section is only relevant for versions before <a href="/template/changes#1.0.0">1.0.0</a>
  where changes are now saved automatically on the options page.
</p>
<p>
  On the options page be sure that you always press <em>&quot;Save &amp; Close&quot;</em>
  button whenever you want to save your changes. This applies even when you are
  only adding, deleting, reordering and importing templates.
