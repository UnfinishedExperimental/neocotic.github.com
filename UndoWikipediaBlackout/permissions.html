<p>
  The <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> permissions mentioned
  on this page are required by the <a href="/UndoWikipediaBlackout">Undo Wikipedia Blackout</a>
  extension to function.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these permissions can be quite scary so I have attempted to explain why
  each one is required. If you doubt these explanations or are simply curious please
  feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/UndoWikipediaBlackout">source code</a>
  yourself. It is open source after all.

  These permissions are displayed on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gbgogigdaibinioohdhejplmajgkkfdn">extension's page</a>
  and on the warning message displayed to the user;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your data on neocotic.com&quot;</strong> - This is required to
    for the <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/inline_installation.html">inline installations</a>
    process to update the <em>Install</em> buttons on the homepage once <a href="/UndoWikipediaBlackout">Undo Wikipedia Blackout</a>
    has been successfully installed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your data on wikipedia.org&quot;</strong> - This is caused by
    the need to inject the script that prevents the blackout from being displayed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your tabs and browsing activity&quot;</strong> - This is caused
    by the need to inject the blackout prevention script in all previously opened
    pages on <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. This functionality is
    required when installing/updating the extension.
  </li>
</ul>
