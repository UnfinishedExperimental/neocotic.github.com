<h3><a name="reason"></a>Why create this extension?</h3>
<p>
  Although I respect and support <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and
  their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative">fight against <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</abbr></a>,
  I found myself lost without it so I created this workaround, which I thought
  I would then share with the world.
</p>
<p>
  The extension has been designed in such a way that any future blackouts could
  easily be bypassed with few changes.
</p>
<h3><a name="permissions"></a>Why do you need this permission...?</h3>
<p>
  I've seen people commenting a lot on extensions in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  about the permissions required by that extension. Most of these comments are
  negative and usually posted by people who do not fully understand the creation
  of Chrome extensions. For this reason I have <a href="/UndoWikipediaBlackout/permissions">created a breakdown</a>
  of the permissions used by <a href="/UndoWikipediaBlackout">Undo Wikipedia Blackout</a>.
  However, if you have trust issues and don't trust that summary why not <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/UndoWikipediaBlackout">look at the code</a>
  and see for yourself.
</p>
<h3><a name="languages"></a>How can I get Undo Wikipedia Blackout in a different language?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, this extension is only provided in the English but I am hoping to
  support more languages in the future. I am currently working on a method of allowing
  others to easily submit translations and I will update this space when it is
  available.
