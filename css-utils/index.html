  <a href="/css-utils">css-utils</a> is a utility for providing common CSS3 classes
  in a single file.
</p>
<p>
  I found myself rewriting so many standard classes for every website I created
  and so I decided to group all of these general classes in to a single file.
</p>
<p>
  The classes provided are simple in design and function with the idea that you
  use multiple classes on your <abbr rel="tooltip" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
  elements as opposed to creating more complex classes for single elements. Obviously
  this approach isn’t always the best but it gives you that option and comes in
  exceptionally handy for blogs.
</p>
<h2><a name="classes"></a>Classes</h2>
<p>
  Since there are potentially over 800 classes provided I highly recommend that
  you take a look at the file you want to use for an idea of what classes are
  available.
</p>
<p>
  That said; the naming conventions I’ve used for the selectors are pretty standard
  and simple to avoid confusion. Some of the longer names also have shorter versions
  available to make the <abbr rel="tooltip" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
  a bit cleaner and more understandable without the need for an inspector tool.
</p>
<h2><a name="files"></a>Which file should I use?</h2>
<p>
  There are two choices as to what file you want to use based on whether or not
  you want to have colour-specific classes available.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>utils.css</code> – Standard classes</li>
  <li>
    <code>utils.colors.css</code> – Standard &amp; colour-specific classes
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  I created this choice because over 500 additional classes exist for the colours
  alone as all <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>
  colours are included and not all users may need them so a lighter option is available.
</p>
<h2><a name="conflicts"></a>Possible Conflicts</h2>
<p>
  Given how many new classes you're adding there is a clear possibility of conflicting
  class names so you should always test your pages after adding <a href="/css-utils">css-utils</a>
  as your implementation of a class may differ from this.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/css-utils">css-utils</a> doesn’t add the <code>!important</code> rule
  to any of the styles applied in an attempt to minimize unwanted conflicts.
