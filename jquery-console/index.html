  <a href="/jquery-console">jQuery Console</a> is a plugin for <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
  that simulates a console/terminal environment within the browser.
</p>
<p>
  I originally created the plugin to be used as part of my old <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub page</a>
  but then realised it had more appeal and potential after working on it so long.
  Eventually I decided to tidy it up and release individually as a <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>
  plugin.
</p>
<p>
  Once I have documented and tidied the code as well as finalising the <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
  I will make a full release of the plugin and publish it on the <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/">jQuery plugins directory</a>.
  I hope to get this done soon but in the meantime you can hopefully get a good
  understanding of how to use it by looking at the code.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the complexity I would like to take my time and write some good documentation
  and examples of its usage before the first release to help avoid initial confusion.
