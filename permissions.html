<p>
  The <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> permissions mentioned
  on this page are required by the <a href="/template">Template</a> extension to
  function.
</p>
<p>
  Some of these permissions can be quite scary so I have attempted to explain why
  each one is required. If you doubt these explanations or are simply curious please
  feel free to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/template">source code</a>
  yourself. It is open source after all.

  These permissions are displayed on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dcjnfaoifoefmnbhhlbppaebgnccfddf">extension's page</a>
  and on the warning message displayed to the user;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Data you copy and paste&quot;</strong> - Although this is a no-brainer
    for most of you, some long-term users may wonder why this wasn't always displayed.
    Well, that's because this permission didn't even exist until <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/whats_new.html#13">Chrome 13</a>
    where it was introduced.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your browsing history&quot;</strong> - This is caused by the
    need to inject the keyboard shortcut and selection script in to all previously
    opened pages. This functionality is required when installing/updating the extension.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;Your data on all websites&quot;</strong> - This is caused by
    the need to read the <abbr rel="twipsy" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
    and page title as well as injecting the keyboard shortcut and selection script
    in to all possible pages.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

  Users are not informed about these permissions but are required by this extension;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;contextMenus&quot;</strong> - This is required to support the
    context (right-click) menus.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;cookies&quot;</strong> - This is required to make cookie information
    accessible to templates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>&quot;notifications&quot;</strong> - This is required to display notifications
    to the user (if the associated option is enabled).
