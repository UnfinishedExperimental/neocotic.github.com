<p>
  <a href="/blingier">blingier</a> is a <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
  shortener engine powered entirely by Java and designed to run anywhere (with
  minimum tweaks) that allows anyone to host their very own service.
</p>
<p>
  Inspired by the open source <a href="http://yourls.org">YOURLS</a> and based solely
  on the <a href="/blingaer">blingaer</a> project, <a href="/blingier">blingier</a>
  attempts to provide all the features and power of <a href="/blingaer">blingaer</a>
  without the requirement of the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/blingier">blingier</a> will remain in the planning stage until development
  on <a href="/blingaer">blingaer</a> is complete and a stable version is publicly
  released.
